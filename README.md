# Shopping-List
## Shopping-List
An application that allows the user to add products

The application requests currency data rates from the [Exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/ "Exchange rates API Homepage") and then dynamically updates the web page using the new data from the server.

The application is available to be tested at https://pontus-shopping-list.herokuapp.com/.
