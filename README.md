# Shopping-List
A full stack application that allows the user to add, edit and delete products. The user can search among products either by searching for a specific name or by category. Products can be added to a cart and even printed out to create a shopping list.

The client is written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. The server uses Node.js and Express. The database uses MongoDB.

The application requests currency data rates from the [Exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/ "Exchange rates API Homepage") and then dynamically updates the web page using the new data from the server.

The application is available to be tested at www.pontus-shopping-list.herokuapp.com.
The database for the running demo is hosted at www.mongodb.com
